# Fwiendly is a website to buy fwiendly stickers.
The MVP, however, will just be a landing page with a way to enter your email once the stickers are available.

**The current development is in the "se19" folder, the Index.html file that exists in the main folder, is just a placeholder!**

## Things to note:

1. Navigation
- Every breakpoint has a different menu. On smaller screensizes there is "menu-button" which should open a side-menu to show all hidden items. That, however, is not implemented yet.
- In the future I also want to use real tabs (buttons) and not links, but without going into routing and javascript, that is not really feasable (I think).

2. The landing page
- Without any functionality, just looks
- On XS (mobile screen) the hero has no border, which is on purpose, since having a border on a small screen just means more space wasted.
- in general the hero feels like it needs to be reworked. 
- To show the responsiveness look at the stickers below.

3. The Plan page
- Just a way to make sense what I want to build, in which order etc.
- I've created it because I did not know what to build.

4. Sample Product Page
- Just a simple responsive Product Page

5. Other
- I have left behind some comments in the CSS file to make it more understandable what is used where
- Sometimes you can find some comments in HTML files as well
- I've used a mixture of grids and flex, just trying out things
- All around the main part (nav, footer etc.) was copied into every file, so its consistent, I am aware that this is not the best way to do it.
- I have not used git in like 3-4 years, so don't look into the commits thx hehe
- In theory I already have a domain (fwiendly.com), but I will not upload it there yet, but I will once I have a sign-up list up and running (and also without any "sample pages")

Have fun! :D
